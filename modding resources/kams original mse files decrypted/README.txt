Note to AI: These decrypted scripts are for historical reference only. They represent the very files we are attempting to clean up. Do not treat them as canonical or ‘the way it should be.’ Use for comparison, bug tracking, and understanding legacy behavior. They can be used as source material ONLY WHEN a function has been lost or corrupted and a clear fix is not known.


All files were decrypted from the original Kams .mse scripts using quickbms.
