Experimental modifications to Goldfish's 2018 Edition of Kam's GTA Scripts (2005)

As the title suggests, nothing you find here should be considered finished; or
even stable, for that matter. But, as much the same could be said about the
original scripts, that's why I'm doing this. As I personally am not much of
a progammer, you have AI to thank for any miracles you might see performed here.
