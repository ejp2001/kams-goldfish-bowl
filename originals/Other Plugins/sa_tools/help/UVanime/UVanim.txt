screen1... We make a model, texture it, pre-cast it if necessary and export it to DFF...
We don't need this model for now...

screen2... (red) we create a simple material, load a texture for animation into it. You don't have to make a new material, but use what the model is textured with...

Strictly speaking, the texture itself is not really needed - we need animation...

(green) For clarity, you can, but it is not necessary, make a plane and apply a material with a texture to it... You can also use the basic model...

(blue) Set the boundaries of the animation keys... (standard 3d max)
screen3... MAXscript/run script/ .... Run the script. Press the "Select Material" button and select
a material with an uploaded texture...
screenshot 4... Turn on AUTO-KEY and create an animation using ONLY the U V offset, U V Tiling parameters...

screenshot 5... First, press the button to select the DFF (red)... Next, a list of textures used in this DFF will appear. The ones marked (A) are already animated. Select a texture for animation (blue)...

That's it - press APPEND ANIMATION...
For now, to avoid locking the models, the DFF will not be overwritten, the new DFF will be in the same folder and will be called temp_<NAME DFF>.DFF .

There is no rotation yet... And there was no rotation there, although it is possible... There is a system of "rotations" like in KUL objects - 2 parameters.....

You can add more than one animation... I made two... I did not test more... (Of course, on different textures)

I don't know - maybe there is a frame limit... (I'm not sure)
