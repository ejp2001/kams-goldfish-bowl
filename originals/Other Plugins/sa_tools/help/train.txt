1. Run the script... It is useful for familiarization to import the CA paths and
just take a look....

I remind you that the path files are -

data\paths\tracks.dat - the main path
data\paths\tracks2.dat - a small path (looks like a SF port)
data\paths\tracks3.dat - SF tram
data\paths\tracks4.dat - oncoming paths LS-SF
data\paths\spath0.dat - I didn't see any trains there

don't confuse them with the files
data\paths\train.dat
data\paths\train2.dat - I don't know what they are for

2. To make the paths - you just need to draw a spline (line) in the middle
of the rail... IMPORTANT - the spline must be one piece... If it was assembled
from several, then you just need to make WELD for all the points...
DO NOT close the path - look as done in the originals....

3. to make a station - go to vertex mode, select one or
more points for stations... Press SET STATION in the script window...
A helper will appear, tied to a spline... To delete a station -
simply delete this helper

4. Export... Select only SPLINE and press export....
