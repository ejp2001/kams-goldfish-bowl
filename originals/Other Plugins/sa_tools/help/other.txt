The pack also includes such little things as:

1. Copy as lod - creates copies of selected objects with LOD names

2. copy no index - creates copies of selected objects without indexing the names

3. IDE from selection - If you need to make an IDE file for selected objects, then simply
type their THD, initial IDE number, drawing distance and flag... Press Create...
The result can be seen in Listener (F11)

4. Deselect same name - removes objects with the same names from the selection... For example, there are
"box01", "box02", "box01", "domik", "domik" after the script only
"box01", "box02", "domik" will remain selected...
