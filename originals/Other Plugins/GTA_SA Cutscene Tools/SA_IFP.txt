SA_IFP.ms – script for recording and editing IFP files (ANP3), such as ped.ifp.
Allows you to create a new IFP file, add animation to the IFP file and replace the animation. 
Under no circumstances should you try to edit IFP files that have been processed by the GTA_IFP_IO.ms script. 
The GTA_IFP_IO.ms script does not correctly record the end-of-file offset.

Button “Load IFP” - load an IFP file.
Button “M” - write down the initial coordinates of the object *
Button “Apply Animation” - assign animation to an object *
Button "R" - cancel assigned animation *

“Batch Import Animation” - assign more than one animation. *
Useful in cases where you need to glue several animations into one. 

“Export Animation” - a group of buttons for recording, adding and overwriting animation. 
In the input field “Anim. Name" we write the name of the animation.
